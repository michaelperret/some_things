### Instructions:

Number game is played by calling `./numgame.py`

Chessercise is called via `./chessercise.py --piece [PIECE] --position [POSITION]`
Tests for chessercise utilize nose. I recommend setting up a virtual environment and installing from requirements.txt
Once nose is installed, simply run `nosetests test_chessercise.py`
